# LaMAGIC and LaMAGIC2: Language-Model-based Topology Generation for Analog Integrated Circuits

### Published at ICML 2024 & ICML 2025

This repository provides the official implementation of LaMAGIC and LaMAGIC2, two approaches leveraging Language Models (LMs) for automated topology generation of analog integrated circuits.

* **LaMAGIC** ([ICML'24 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18269))
* **LaMAGIC2** ([ICML'25 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10235))

## Installation

### Environment Setup

First, create a Conda environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Git LFS for Large Files

After cloning the repository, fetch large dataset files using:

```bash
git lfs pull
```

---

## Dataset and Model Setup

### Base Model

Download the pretrained `flan-T5-base` model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base). Update the model path in all YAML configuration files located in:

```
analog_LLM/configs
```

### Dataset

Clone the dataset from [LaMAGIC-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/turtleben/LaMAGIC-dataset).

Target data is located at:

```
[your_save_path]/LaMAGIC-dataset/transformed
```

* For LaMAGIC2 SOTA experiments, use:

  * `LaMAGIC2/SFCI_345comp.json`
  * `LaMAGIC2/SFCI_6comp.json`

## Training

Training scripts are organized by each paper under the `experiment` directory.

### LaMAGIC (ICML'24)

#### Initial training on 3, 4, and 5-component circuits:

* **Na√Øve (NF), Canonical (CF), Canonical + Duty Cycle (CFDC)**:

```bash
python experiment/lamagic1/trn_LLM_instruction.py
```

* **Pure-text adjacency-matrix (PM)**:

```bash
python experiment/lamagic1/trn_LLM_pure_text_matrix_form.py
```

* **Float-input adjacency-matrix (FM)** *(core contribution)*:

```bash
python experiment/lamagic1/trn_LLM_float_input_matrix_form.py
```

#### Fine-tuning on 6-component circuits (limited data: 500, 1000, 2000 samples):

```bash
python experiment/lamagic1/trn_LLM_6_comp.py
```

---

### LaMAGIC2 (ICML'25)

#### Initial training on 3, 4, and 5-component circuits:

* **Succinct Float-input Matrix (SFM), Succinct Float-input Canonical with Identifier (SFCI)** *(core contribution)*:

```bash
python experiment/lamagic2/trn_pure_tranformer.py
```

#### Fine-tuning on 6-component circuits (limited data: 500, 1000, 2000 samples):

```bash
python experiment/lamagic2/trn_pure_tranformer_6comp.py
```
